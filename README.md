# Orbitscope
Satellite debris analysis and visualization using real TLE data from Celestrak.

**Project Description:** OrbitScope is a data visualization project that maps and analyzes orbital debris generated by the Chinese ASAT (Anti-Satellite) Test on FENGYUN-1C. Using real-world satellite data from Celestrak, this project extracts Two-Line Element (TLE) data, simulates orbital positions in 3D space, and visualizes the distribution of debris orbiting Earth.
The goal is to make space debris data understandable and interactive — showing how thousands of fragments from a single collision can remain in orbit for decades, posing a major risk to active satellites and future missions.

**Key Objectives:**

1. Fetch and parse real satellite debris TLE data from Celestrak
2. Compute orbital parameters like inclination, altitude, and period
3. Build 3D orbit visualizations using Plotly and Matplotlib
4. Display global debris distribution patterns
5. Raise awareness about the growing problem of space junk

**Tech Stack:**

1. Python
2. Libraries: `Skyfield`, `Plotly`, `Matplotlib`, `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Requests`
3. Dataset Source: Celestrak - FENGYUN 1C Debris TLE Data
4. Platform: Google Colab

**1. Orbit Inclination Distribution**

This histogram visualizes the orbital tilt of debris fragments produced by the FENGYUN-1C satellite breakup. Most fragments have a tilt of around 98–100°, meaning they move in near-polar orbits — passing over the Earth’s poles instead of circling around the equator. This pattern shows how the debris spreads globally, covering almost every part of the planet during its orbit.

**2. Interactive 3D Orbit Viewer (Plotly)**

An interactive 3D view of debris orbits built using Plotly. You can rotate, zoom, and explore each fragment’s path around Earth in real time. The blue sphere represents our planet, while the lines trace debris trajectories — showing how chaotic and overlapping low-Earth orbit (LEO) has become.

**3. Multi-Orbit 3D Plot (Matplotlib)**

This plot shows hundreds of pieces of space debris orbiting Earth in 3D. Each colored line represents one fragment from the FENGYUN-1C satellite breakup. The dense web of paths around the planet reveals just how cluttered Earth’s low orbit has become, with debris circling in all directions.



**Why this is important?**
After China’s 2007 anti-satellite test, over 3,000 trackable debris objects were created — many of which are still orbiting today. Visualizing this data emphasizes how human activity has cluttered near-Earth space, and why sustainable space practices are crucial for the future of space missions.

**Future Scope**
1. Integrate live tracking of debris positions using NORAD updates
2. Build a dashboard for real-time orbit monitoring
3. Use machine learning to predict potential collision risks
4. Extend visualization to include Starlink and other constellations
