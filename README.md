# Orbitscope
Satellite debris analysis and visualization using real TLE data from Celestrak.

**Project Title: OrbitScope – 3D Visualization of Space Debris Orbits**

**Project Description:** OrbitScope is a data visualization project that maps and analyzes orbital debris generated by the Chinese ASAT (Anti-Satellite) Test on FENGYUN-1C. Using real-world satellite data from Celestrak, this project extracts Two-Line Element (TLE) data, simulates orbital positions in 3D space, and visualizes the distribution of debris orbiting Earth.
The goal is to make space debris data understandable and interactive — showing how thousands of fragments from a single collision can remain in orbit for decades, posing a major risk to active satellites and future missions.

**Key Objectives:**

1. Fetch and parse real satellite debris TLE data from Celestrak
2. Compute orbital parameters like inclination, altitude, and period
3. Build 3D orbit visualizations using Plotly and Matplotlib
4. Display global debris distribution patterns
5. Raise awareness about the growing problem of space junk

**Tech Stack:**

1. Python
2. Libraries: `Skyfield`, `Plotly`, `Matplotlib`, `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Requests`
3. Dataset Source: Celestrak - FENGYUN 1C Debris TLE Data
4. Platform: Google Colab

**1. Orbit Inclination Distribution**

This histogram displays the inclination angles (orbital tilt) of debris fragments created by the FENGYUN-1C satellite destruction event. Most fragments cluster around *98–100°*, indicating near-polar orbits — meaning these debris pieces circle Earth almost from pole to pole.

**2. Multi-Orbit 3D Plot (Matplotlib)**

This visualization plots hundreds of debris orbits around Earth in 3D using Matplotlib. The dense mesh of lines shows just how crowded Earth’s low orbit has become. Each colored curve represents one debris fragment orbiting independently.

**3. Interactive 3D Orbit Viewer (Plotly)**

An interactive version of the orbital visualization built using `Plotly`. You can rotate, zoom, and explore debris trajectories in real time. Each line shows the orbital path of one debris piece, with Earth at the center (blue sphere). This view highlights the chaotic and overlapping nature of orbital debris in LEO (Low Earth Orbit).



**Why this is important?**
After China’s 2007 anti-satellite test, over 3,000 trackable debris objects were created — many of which are still orbiting today. Visualizing this data emphasizes how human activity has cluttered near-Earth space, and why sustainable space practices are crucial for the future of space missions.

**Future Scope**
1. Integrate live tracking of debris positions using NORAD updates
2. Build a dashboard for real-time orbit monitoring
3. Use machine learning to predict potential collision risks
4. Extend visualization to include Starlink and other constellations
